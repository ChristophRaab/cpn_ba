# Instructions

To set up this directory, download the CodeData archive (currently available [here](https://cloud.fhws.de/index.php/s/tJUiZabbY9cMexh)) and extract the contents in this directory. That means `requirements.md` and `extract_bottleneck_features.py` should be in this directory. Afterwards extract the dog image dataset to the subdirectory `dogImages`. If all is well, `CodeData/dogImages/train` should exist.
