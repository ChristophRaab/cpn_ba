# Instructions

To set up this directory, download the CodeData archive (Christoph Raab can provide you with a link) and extract the contents in this directory. `requirements.md` and `extract_bottleneck_features.py` should be in this directory. Afterwards extract the dog image dataset to the subdirectory `dogImages`. If all is well, `CodeData/dogImages/train` should exist (next to `CodeData/Instructions.md`).
